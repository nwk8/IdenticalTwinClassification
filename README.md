# IdenticalTwinClassification
## WhoRU? - The Facial Recognition Platform ## Identical Twin Classification Project

## Project Overview
This project classifies images of identical twins, identifying whether a given image belongs to "You" or your twin. It demonstrates the use of classical machine learning models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression) and deep learning models (CNN / pre-trained models) with proper evaluation metrics, including confusion matrices, precision, recall, and F1-scores.

The project is designed to run in Python, and can optionally include a simple web interface for image upload and prediction.
